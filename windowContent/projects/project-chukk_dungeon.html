    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chukk's Dungeon is a game developed as a final project for the Video Games II course. This game was created as a team using Unity over a period of three weeks. The adventure takes place in a dungeon, whose layout is fully generated randomly for each new game. The contents of the chests and the arrangement of rooms also vary unpredictably. Each dungeon includes a boss room where a dragon must be defeated. Once the dragon is defeated, a new, larger, and more complex dungeon is generated.</p>
